Hi there!
Welcome to my homework on virtual environments.

## Here is the algorithm for running my file
Python version used: Python 3.11.3

OS version: MacOS Ventura 13.3.1

In my repository you will find a file called "requirements.txt", it will be useful for running the file

**So, the steps are the following:**
1) Create and activate a new virtual environment by using conda or virtualenv:
In conda:
- conda create --name (insert your virtual_env name)
- conda activate (insert your virtual_env name)

3) After you've activated your new virtual environemnt, run the following command:
    "requirements.txt" in your terminal
