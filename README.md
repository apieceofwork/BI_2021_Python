Hi there!
Welcome to my homework on virtual environments

## Here is the algorithm for running "pain.py"
Python version used: Python 3.11.3

OS version: MacOS Ventura 13.3.1

In my repository you will find a file called "requirements.txt". It contains all the packages needed for running the file, "pain.py"

**So, the steps are the following:**
1) Create and activate a new virtual environment by using conda or virtualenv:

*For virtualenv:*

- `virtualenv (insert your virtual_env name)`
- `source virtual_env name/bin/activate`

*For conda:*
- `conda create --name (insert your virtual_env name)`
- `conda activate (insert your virtual_env name)`

2) Then you have to download my file "requirements.txt" to your computer.

To do that, you have to copy my repository to your computer: `git clone https://github.com/apieceofwork/BI_2021_Python'. As my file lies in a branch different from master you have to go to that specific branch to run "requirements.txt" as a result.

Run this command `git checkout New-IB-Python-Challenges`. Now you have been transfered to "New-IB-Python-Challenges" branch where the file is

3) After you've activated your new virtual environment, you need to install all the packages listed in "requirements.txt"

*For virtualenv:*

run this command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   
*For conda:*

- while the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` usually works, conda doesnâ€™t support this option directly

- instead use this command: `while read requirement; do conda install --yes $requirement; done < requirements.txt`

It will install the needed packages in your virtual environment

Wait till you see "# All requested packages already installed."

4) Now when the packages have been installed, you can run "pain.py"
   
Use this command: `python pain.py`

5) Great! Everything works! Here is the output of "pain.py":
